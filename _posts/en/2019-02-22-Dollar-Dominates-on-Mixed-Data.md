The USD/CAD is building on yesterday’s reversal, but struggling to break through 1.3250. Meanwhile, the USD/CHF continues to hold just above 1.0000. 

The USD/JPY is slightly higher, with the 111.00 level the next barrier to test. The EUR/JPY is sitting just below the February highs, with the GBP/JPY poised after two rangebound days. The AUD/JPY remains pressured and is unchanged after yesterday’s reversal.

The GBP/JPY has shown remarkable resilience in the face of Brexit uncertainty. Overhead resistance has proven tricky, but should this break, the next target is above 148.00.
