## Morning Report: 07.00 London

This morning, the US dollar index is unchanged after two days of solid gains this morning, helping some dollar pairs to gain. 

The EUR/USD is making small gains after holding the 1.1200 level yesterday. The GBP/USD is also attempting gains after further selling yesterday that pushed the pair towards 1.2900. The EUR/GBP is setting itself up for its eighth day of gains as the pound continues to struggle. This comes after UK average earnings dropped more than expected yesterday. 

The AUD/USD continues to struggle as China posts worsening industrial production this morning. The pair is falling for the third straight session below 0.6950.  

The USD/CHF is unchanged after yesterday’s rebound from 1.0050. The EUR/CHF is also recovering after retaining the 1.1300 level. 

The USD/JPY is unchanged after yesterday’s counter rally. The AUD/JPY is lower and testing support at 76.00. The EUR/JPY is rallying for the second straight day after holding the 1.2250. The GBP/JPY is following suit. 

## Coming up today	

Today, we have Canadian inflation data at 12.30. At the same time, we get US retail sales. 

FOMC member Quarles speaks at 13.30. 

## Trade Idea

The Australian dollar appears vulnerable as Chinese industrial production falters.
