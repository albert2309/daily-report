## Morning Report: 07.00 London

This morning, the US dollar index is reversing Friday’s payrolls inspired gains. Non-Farm Employment Change came in above estimates at +196k, beating estimates after last month’s slump. 

The EUR/USD and GBP/USD are making gains as a result, with the EUR/USD rallying after holding the 1.1200 level. The GBP/USD is also reversing two days of heavy losses after holding the 1.3000 level on Friday. The EUR/GBP is on the back foot, but the pair remains broadly rangebound. 

The AUD/USD is lower for the third day in a row though as the pair struggles to best last week’s highs. Another commodity driven pair, the USD/CAD is also bucking the wider trend, with the pair back up to unchanged after gapping lower at the open. 

The USD/CHF is reversing steadily from the 1.0000 level after breaking above it on Friday. 

Yen pairs are lower, led by the USD/JPY which is reversing the pair’s steady rally from the 110.00 level from the March lows. The GBP/JPY is lower for the third straight day, slipping below the 1460 level again, while the EUR/JPY is lower but holding the 125.00 level for now. The AUD/JPY is one of the bigger fallers, testing the 79.00 level this morning. 

## Coming up today

There are no upper to middle tier items today. 

US factory orders is the standout item at 14.00. 

## Trade Idea

The Australian dollar continues to slip lower and there could be lower levels to come if the RBA’s dovish approach continues.
