## Morning Report: 07.00 London

This morning, the Japanese yen and Swiss franc are strong as safe havens rise in demand. The China-US trade deal differences appear to be widening despite Trump’s reassurances. US CPI also came in below estimates on Friday. 

The USD/JPY has gapped below 110.00 to trade at 109.70 this morning. The AUD/JPY is also struggling, with the Aussie hit by China contagion. By contrast the EUR/JPY is unchanged and the GBP/JPY is nudging back to unchanged after gapping lower. 

The dollar index is on the rise, pushing dollar pairs lower. The AUD/USD is struggling and heading for the lows after gapping below 0.7000. The GBP/USD is making small gains as the 1.3000 level holds. The EUR/USD is slipping back slightly though, helping the EUR/GBP to reverse after five straight days of gains. 

The Swissy continues to make gains after the USD/CHF gapped lower to test the 1.0100 level once again. The EUR/CHF is also struggling and has fallen to test the 1.1350 level once again. 

After suffering heavy falls on Friday, the USD/CAD has risen again to hold the 1.3400 level. 

## Coming up today	

Today, we have US FOMC member Clarida speaking at 13.10. 

RBC governing council member Lane speaks at 21.30. 

## Trade Idea

The Swiss franc is in demand and this trend to could continue as the trade war sinks lower. The euro is struggling right now, making the EUR/CHF an attractive bearish bet.
