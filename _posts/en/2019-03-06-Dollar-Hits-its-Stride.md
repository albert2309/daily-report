## Morning Report: 07.00 London

The US dollar index is hitting its stride, posting gains for the sixth straight day. The February highs are in sight, forcing the dollar pairs lower. 

The AUD/USD is hardest hit, plunging below 0.7050 this morning. The EUR/USD is also struggling, falling for its sixth straight day and looking to test support around 1.1300. The poundâ€™s out-performance has proven short lived, falling for the fifth straight day from the highs around 1.3300 to just above 1.3100 as Brexit uncertainty begins to bite again. The EUR/GBP is on the rise above 0.8600 as the pound bows to euro pressure. 

The USD/CAD is continuing its rally as political uncertainty weighs on the Canadian dollar. Even the USD/CHF managed to break its impasse around 1.0000, rallying to 1.0050 yesterday with follow on buying this morning. 

Yen pairs have a negative bias though, with even the USD/JPY struggling to lift above support around 112.00. The AUD/JPY has dropped below 79.00, with the EUR/JPY nudging lower for the third straight day. The GBP/JPY is following suit.
