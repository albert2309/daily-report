## Morning Report: 07.00 London

The US dollar index was boosted yesterday as the FOMC quashed any speculation of a rate cut, downplaying inflation fears. There is a rebound of sorts this morning though. 

Dollar pairs are in recovery mode after selling off yesterday. The AUD/USD dropped back towards support at 0.7000. 

The EUR/USD was volatile, closing well below the day’s highs, but only slightly below the days open and holding the 1.1200 support level. The EUR/CHF is also holding support at 1.14 after reversing heavily yesterday. 

The EUR/GBP reversed below the 0.8600 level yesterday as the pound out-performed the euro. The GBP/USD itself held up relatively well, posting gains while other dollar pairs reversed and is unchanged this morning. 

The USD/CAD saw some of the biggest gains yesterday, reversing most of Monday’s losses, with small buying this morning. 

The USD/CHF remains rangebound, dropping below 1.0150 yesterday, but ultimately closing only slightly below 1.0200. 

Yen pairs are on the rise, with the USD/JPY rallying for the second straight day. Other yen pairs are also posting slight gains, with the GBP/JPY rallying for the third straight day.  

## Coming up today	

At 11.00, we have the UK BOE inflation report, MPC official bank rate votes, official bank rate and policy summary. BOE governor Carney speaks at 11.30. 

## Trade Idea

With the threat of a US rate cutting seeming to be put on the back burner, now could be a good time to bet against dollar pairs. This is especially the case for the AUD/USD which is struggling in the face of a weakening China.
