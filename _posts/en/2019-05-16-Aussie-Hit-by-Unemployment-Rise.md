## Morning Report: 07.00 London

The Australian dollar is hurting today as a result of higher than expected unemployment figures. The AUD/USD is off the lows, but still seems set for its fourth straight day of losses. The AUD/JPY continues to struggle, falling to its lowest levels since the beginning of the year. 

Dollar pairs are mixed as the dollar index slips back to an unchanged level this morning. The EUR/USD is making small gains and holding support at 1.1200. The GBP/USD is also unchanged, but at least has so far halted the consistent slide that has been in place since the 6th. The EUR/GBP is unchanged after eight straight days of gains, with yesterday being a possible exhaustion point. 

The USD/CHF remains rangebound as the 1.0500 level continues to hold. The EUR/CHF is also pausing and holding the 1.1300 support level that has proven sticky this week. 

The USD/JPY is unchanged but still appears vulnerable with the lows in sight. The GBP/JPY is unchanged this morning, but the downtrend remains firmly on track. The EUR/JPY is following suit. The worst performer is the AUD/JPY which continues to struggle in the face of a China and domestic slowdown.
