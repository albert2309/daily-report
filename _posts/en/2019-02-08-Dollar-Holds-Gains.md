## Morning Report: 07.00 London

The US dollar index is building on its recent bull run, rallying for the sixth straight day after Trump ruled out meeting China’s President Xi before a deadline for tariff increases. 

The AUD/USD is slipping lower, falling to break through the mid-January lows, while the AUD/JPY follows the same pattern to test the 77.50 level. 

The EUR/USD is unchanged this morning, potentially halting four straight days of losses, with support holding in the 1.1340 region. The GBP/USD is also unchanged following yesterday's out-performance. Despite ongoing Brexit uncertainty, the EUR/GBP is making small gains after two days of losses in the pound’s favour. 

The EUR/JPY is off for the fourth straight day, while the GBP/JPY has slipped lower again to test the 142.00 level. 

The USD/CAD continues to rally hard as the US dollar makes ground against the Canadian dollar. The USD/CHF is unchanged as the pair hold the parity line. 

## Coming up today

Today, we have Canadian Employment change and unemployment rate data at 13.30. 

## Trade Idea

While the focus has been on golds stellar rise in 2019, silver has also performed well and made gains that have gone under the radar.
