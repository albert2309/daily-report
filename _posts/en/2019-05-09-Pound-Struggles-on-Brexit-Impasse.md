## Morning Report: 07.00 London

The British pound continues to struggle this morning, with the GBP/JPY sitting just above support at 143.00 after slumping below 144.00 yesterday. This comes as markets grow increasingly restless ahead of European elections. The GBP/USD is making small gains this morning, but this comes after three days of heaving selling. The 1.3000 level is holding for now. The pound is showing a little fight against the euro after the EUR/GBP pushed through the 0.8600 level yesterday. 

Yen pairs generally are on the back foot as risk appetite takes hold in the context of China trade deal worries. The USD/JPY is slipping below 110.00 this morning. The EUR/JPY is slipping lower for its third straight day, while the AUD/JPY is slumping further below 77.00. 

The Aussie is also struggling against the US dollar, with the AUD/USD set to test the May lows around 0.6975. The EUR/USD is unchanged but range bound. 

Meanwhile the USD/CAD is setting for another attempt at the highs, trading just below support at 1.3500 this morning. The USD/CHF is slipping back though as the dollar gives way to other safe havens. 

## Coming up today	

Today we have Canadian Trade balance at 12.30, released alongside PPI and Fed Chair Powell speaking. 

## Trade Idea

The AUD/JPY appears vulnerable and the current slump could extend further.
