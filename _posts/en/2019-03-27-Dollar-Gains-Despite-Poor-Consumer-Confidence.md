## Morning Report: 07.00 London

The dollar index is on the rise this morning despite poor US consumer confidence figures last night. The New Zealand dollar is only a small counter weight, but is struggling this morning after the RBNZ offered a dovish rate statement. 

The AUD/USD is one of the worst performers, catching some of the slide from the New Zealand dollar. The AUD/USD has reversed all of yesterday’s losses and is set to test the 0.7100 level. 

The EUR/USD is also sliding and building on yesterday’s losses – Support around 1.1250 is holding for now. The EUR/GBP remains rangebound, with the pair still in sight of March lows as the pound holds most of recent gains. The GBP/USD is lower, but remains within a day’s session of the March highs. 

The USD/CAD is on the rise after two days of losses, though struggling to break the 1.3400 level. The USD/CHF is performing well and extending the move above 0.9950. 

The USD/JPY is unchanged so far after gains yesterday. The AUD/JPY is on the back foot by contrast, with the EUR/JPY also struggling after failing to break 125.00 yesterday. The GBP/JPY is posting smaller gains after falling below the 146.00 level. 

## Coming up today

ECB President Draghi speaks at 08.00. 

At 12.30, we get Canadian trade balance. 

FOMC member George speaks at 21.30. 

## Trade Idea

The AUD/USD continues to struggle from a slow-down in China, with the pair in a slow (very slow) down trend since August. This morning’s New Zealand reversal is adding to the downside momentum this morning.
