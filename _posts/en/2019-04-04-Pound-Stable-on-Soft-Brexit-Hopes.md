## Morning Report: 07.00 London

This morning, the British pound is holding its ground amid growing hopes for a market friendly soft Brexit. The GBP/JPY is unchanged and holding above 146.50, the GBP/USD is also unchanged and trading below 1.3200, while the EUR/GBP is holding near the lows. 

The dollar index is stronger after heavy loss yesterday on the back of weak ADP payroll numbers. 

The EUR/USD is lower slightly after failing to break through the 1.1250 level yesterday. The AUD/USD is also backing off after surging to make good all of Tuesday’s losses. 

The USD/CAD is higher again and attempting to break through the 1.3350 level for the first time this week. The USD/CHF is back on the rise after selling off following the failed break of 1.0000 on Tuesday. 

Yen pairs are mixed, with the USD/JPY unchanged but within a short distance of breaking 111.50. The AUD/JPY is on the back foot, but holding the bulk of yesterday’s gains. Meanwhile, the EUR/JPY is unchanged after posting its highest levels for the week yesterday. 

Gold is posting small gains, but generally continues to struggle after the late March slide. 

## Coming up today

Today, we have the ECB monetary policy meeting accounts at 11.30. 

Canadian Ivey PMI is at 14.00. 

## Trade Idea

The GBP/USD is showing signs of stability as confidence for a soft Brexit grows as we enter the end game.
