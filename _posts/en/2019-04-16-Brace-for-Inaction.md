The EUR/USD is unchanged, but holding above the 1.1300 level, while the GBP/USD is lower and trading below 1.3100 ahead of today’s average earning’s data. The EUR/GBP is back on the rise, but trading below the resistance line at 0.8650.

The USD/JPY is lower slightly and trading below resistance at 112.00. The GBP/USD is also lower and reversing yesterday’s gains. By contrast the EUR/JPY remains unchanged.

## Trade Idea

Aside from the opening day collapse, 2019’s trend has been good for the USD/JPY. The dollar has gradually strengthened, while safe haven demand for the yen has diminished.
