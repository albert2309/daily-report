## Morning Report: 07.00 London

The US dollar index is on the rise as traders err on the side of caution regarding US-China trade talks. Another round of talks have been announced, but the fact that there has not been a resolution yet has pushed some traders back into their shell. 

Dollar pairs are on the back foot, with the AUD/USD making back to back losses and erasing most of Friday’s gains. 

The EUR/USD is also slipping, reversing yesterday’s gains to test 1.3000 once again. The GBP/USD is also on the back foot and looking to test yesterday’s opening gap higher above 1.2900. The EUR/GBP is unchanged, holding just above 0.8750. 

The USD/CAD is on the rise, closing yesterday’s opening gap lower. The 1.3300 level remains a key challenge. 

The USD/CHF challenged the 1.2500 level yesterday, but has recovered to challenge 1.0050 this morning. 

The USD/JPY is also making gains, but yen pairs are generally on the back foot in line with their dollar counterparts. The AUD/JPY is making back to back losses, while the GBP/JPY sits just above yesterday’s lows. The EUR/JPY is also slipping. 

## Coming up today

Today, we have UK average earnings and the unemployment rate at 09.30. 

German ZEW economic sentiment is at 10.00. 

## Trade Idea

Gold is slipping back slightly today, but the longer term trend remains strong, above $1320. 

With global risks simmering at best, there could be further upside from here for the precious metal.
