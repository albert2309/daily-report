## Morning Report: 07.00 London

The Australian dollar is under scrutiny this morning, with the AUD/JPY falling 1.11% and the AUD/USD by just under 1.00%. The Aussie has now given back all the week’s gains against the dollar and yen. The Aussie is being hit by a Westpac report which predicts two rate cuts this year. In addition, there are reports that Chinese ports are blocking coal imports beyond a cap of 12m tonnes. 

The dollar index is generally on the front foot after a mixed release of FOMC meeting minutes which hinted a dovish shift with potential rate cuts this year. The dollar is on the rise this morning after moderate selling yesterday. 

The EUR/USD is on the back foot, slipping below the 1.1350 level, while the GBP/USD is posting back to back losses. Tuesday’s rally is still holding firm however. The EUR/GBP continues to hold below the 0.8700 level as the euro keeps up its underperformance. 

The USD/CAD is making gains, following four days of losses. Meanwhile, the USD/CHF held the 1.000 level yesterday, with follow up buying this morning. 

The USD/JPY is unchanged as the yen and dollar cancel each other out. Other yen pairs are slightly negative, with the EUR/JPY and GBP/JPY making losses.

## Trade Idea

The Australian dollar has been climbing up stairs, but down escalators of late. The risks are mounting for the Aussie and there could be further downside from here.
